# 2013 Bacalaureat data

Use `../get13.php` to download the required files to this directory, then use `../parse13.php` to parse the files once they finished downloading.

If you would not like to download the files (there are quite a few), then just extract `data13.rar`.

The size of this directory should be 9 GB once populated with freshly downloaded data or 4.5 GB if you extracted the aforementioned archive which only contains stripped data.
