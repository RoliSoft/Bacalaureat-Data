# 2013 Bacalaureat data

Use `../[get13-07|gen13-09].php` to download the required files to this directory, then use `../parse13-[07|09].php` to parse the files once they finished downloading.

If you would not like to download the files (there are quite a few), then just extract `data13-[07|09].rar`.

The size of this directory should be 9 GB + 520 MB once populated with freshly downloaded data or 4.5 GB + 520 MB if you extracted the aforementioned archive which only contains stripped data in case of `13-07`.
