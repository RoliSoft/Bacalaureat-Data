# 2012 Bacalaureat data

Use `../gen12.php` to generate a list of URLs to be downloaded to this directory, then use `../parse12.php` to parse the files once you've downloaded them.

If you would not like to download the files (there are quite a few), then just extract `data12.rar`.

The size of this directory should be 2.1 GB once populated.
